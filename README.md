# 42_MATCHA

## About

This project is all about building a basic shell from scratch in the c language, like our own version of bash. As beginners in programming, it's been a steep learning curve. We've dived into processes, signal handling, file descriptors, and the core workings of shells. Minishell isn't just about coding; it's a journey back in time to understand the challenges before GUI existed. Along the way, we've embraced the struggle, immersed ourselves in documentation, and come out the other side with a deeper understanding and lots of bugs to fix.

**Technologies**: TypeScript, ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, ExpressJS, Docker, PostgreSQL, pg-pool.

### Backend Engineering:
- Utilized literal queries instead of ORMs to deepen database understanding.
- Created custom validators and managed a connection pool while minimizing queries for efficient execution.

### Security Measures:
- Mitigated SQL injection, CSRF, and XSS vulnerabilities by using parameterized queries.
- Stored JWT tokens as HTTP-only cookies with an additional CSRF token for enhanced security.
- Strengthened password security with salts to defend against rainbow table attacks.

### Recommendation System:
- Built an engine to suggest profiles with advanced search capabilities.
- Filtering options include age, fame, interests, and gender.

### Frontend Engineering:
- Created fully responsive interfaces with ReactJS, minimizing backend requests and optimizing rendering.
- Designed the frontend using Figma and implemented it with Tailwind CSS.
